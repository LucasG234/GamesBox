# GamesBox
My Final Project for AP Computer Science
This project is a collection of the games Tic Tac Toe, Checkers, Connect 4, and Dots and Boxes.
The games are all available through one central screen, which reopens whenever any of the games are closed.
The application can be run through the CoolCSGames.jar executable file, which includes all necessary assets.
